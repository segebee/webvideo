This repo is an experiment on the capabilities of HTML5 navigator to access the users camera through the browser

The Navigator interface represents the state and the identity of the user agent. It allows scripts to query it and to register themselves to carry on some activities.

A Navigator object can be retrieved using the read-only [window.navigator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/navigator)  property.

## Properties

Doesn't inherit any properties, but implements those defined in NavigatorID, NavigatorLanguage, NavigatorOnLine, NavigatorContentUtils, NavigatorStorage, NavigatorStorageUtils, NavigatorConcurrentHardware, NavigatorPlugins, and NavigatorUserMedia.
